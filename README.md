# BunBun Recipe App

This is a fairly simple React application showcasing my ability to work with an API.

The app get's its information from https://spoonacular.com/ recipe API.

It's not 100% done yet as I would still like to add more feature, however features included already are pretty cool.

## React features used:

- React Hooks (useState, useEffect)
- React Router
- Styled Components for styling

## External libraries used:

- Splide for carousel
- Framer motion for page transition effects
- React icons
